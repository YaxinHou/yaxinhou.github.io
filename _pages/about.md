### 👨‍💻Profile

<span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:0.8em; text-align:justify;"> I am currently a Ph.D. student at Southeast University, under the supervision of <span style="color:#4B0082;"><strong>Assoc. Prof. Yuheng Jia</strong></span>. I received my M.S. degree from Henan University in 2023, under the supervision of <span style="color:#4B0082;"><strong>Prof. Chongsheng Zhang</strong></span>. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in 2020 from Henan Institute of Engineering. My research interests lie in machine learning, with a focus on long-tailed learning and weakly supervised learning. </span>
